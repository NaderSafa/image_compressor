# image_compressor

This python script reduces the image sizes by bulk significantly to a minimum of FHD (1080px short side) 

When you open the file it asks for the images you need to compress (you can select them in bulk but they
should be in the same folder)

When you select the file compression starts automatically, a new folder is created in the same directory 
with the name "compressed" where the compressed images are saved with a suffix of "_c" and much less size

enjoy your compressed images in jpeg format for your apps and websites.
